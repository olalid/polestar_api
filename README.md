# Polestar API

This application is not an official app affiliated with Polestar.

N.B. There are currently several sensors that report no information for some or all models. Unfortunatly there is nothing the developers of this integration can do about this, but we do recommend you contact Polestar support and express your support for a public API for integration with Home Assistant and similar systems.
